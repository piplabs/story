package keepers

// Keepers have been moved to a separate package to ensure all keepers are accessible in `upgrades.Upgrade.CreateUpgradeHandler`.
// This allows for passing all keepers into the upgrade handler and accessing/changing blockchain state across all modules.
// When performing `ignite scaffold` the keeper will be added to `app.go`. Please move them here.
